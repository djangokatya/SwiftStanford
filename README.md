Me learning Swift/XCode with the Stanford course + YouTube translations of it made by brilliant Ivan Skorokhod.
After each lection I am making adjustments and complicate the program so that it helps me understand the material better.

*These are 2019 Lections and apparently they are MVVC based and not MVC, I will get to it later.*

## What I did by myself:

# Lection 1
I added two functions to make random emojis/backgrounds for the buttons but failed to recreate my whole idea so I moved on and I hope to be able to make it later on.
By Lection 2 I removed them from the working scope but they are at the bottom of the controller file.

# Lection 2
I added a section where after the first matched emoju pair there appears a Textfield with the already matched emojis + a label for that (previously invisible).
